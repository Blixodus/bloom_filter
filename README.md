# A somewhat basic Bloom filter

## Installation

Just download the files and type `make` in the Linux shell

## Interactive mode

To use interactive mode launch the application with `./main -i` or `./main interactive`.

The system currently supports the following commands `add`, `query`, `debug`, `help`, and `exit`.

## Test mode (WIP)

Test mode will implement a feature allowing the user to automatically compare the theoretical performance of the filter to it's real-life performance.
